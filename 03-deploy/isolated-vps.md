Goal: run the Gateway on a Linux VPS while keeping access **private** and the host hardened.

This is a great setup when:

- you want the assistant always-on
- your laptop sleeps often
- you want predictable networking

But the security bar is higher: a VPS is an internet-connected machine.

> **Recommended path:** For most users, follow sections 1-6 (baseline setup), then jump to [section 12 (Tailscale)](#12-tailscale-setup-recommended-intermediate). Tailscale gives you encrypted access, auto-TLS, and zero exposed ports — without needing nginx, certbot, or manual TLS. Sections 13-18 are for advanced users who need public-facing access or additional hardening.

## Post-Deployment: Read This First

> **Before you start using OpenClaw daily**, read these operational gotchas from real users:
>
> - **The 60% Success Rule** — Tasks with >10 steps fail 40% of the time due to context drift
> - **"Draft vs Send" Ambiguity** — Agents may interpret "draft" as "create and send"
> - **Browser Profile Bleed** — Using your daily Chrome profile gives agent access to ALL your logged-in accounts
> - **Dormancy Trap** — Long sessions cause agent to freeze or lose track of context
> - **Always-On Cost** — Running 24/7 costs more than expected (473 requests/day = $847/month in one case)
> - **The Nginx Shield** — Rate limiting is CRITICAL for preventing runaway API costs
>
> See: [Operational Gotchas](../05-worst-case-security/operational-gotchas.md) for 10 real-world usage patterns that go wrong and how to fix them.

---

## Recommended posture (summary)

- Keep Gateway **loopback-only** (`gateway.bind: "loopback"`).
- Access via **Tailscale** (recommended) or SSH tunnel (fallback).
- Use token/password auth — or Tailscale identity-based auth.
- Run as a dedicated non-root user.
- Lock down file permissions.
- Disable mDNS discovery on the VPS.

---

## 1) Provision the VPS (baseline hardening) `[All]`

Based on [VibeProof Security Guide](https://vibeproof.dev/blog/moltbot-security-setup-guide) (uses legacy "Moltbot" name).

> **⚠️ Provider Isolation:** Use a **separate VPS provider** (or at minimum a separate account) from any provider you already use for production services. If OpenClaw triggers TOS violations — outbound spam via prompt injection, a misconfigured gateway relaying abuse, runaway API calls, or content moderation violations from AI-generated messages — the provider may **suspend your entire account**, not just the OpenClaw VPS. That means all your other instances, snapshots, backups, and DNS records on that account go down too. A throwaway $6/month Droplet is not worth risking your production infrastructure.
>
> **See also:** [VPS Risks — Account-Level Blast Radius](../05-worst-case-security/vps-risks.md#i-account-level-blast-radius) for the full threat model.

### Choose a Provider

- AWS EC2: t3.small, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- DigitalOcean: Basic $6/month Droplet, Ubuntu 24.04
- Linode: Nanode 1GB, Ubuntu 24.04
- Hetzner: CX11, Ubuntu 24.04

### SSH Key Setup (if you don't have one)

If you don't already have an SSH key pair, generate one on your **local machine** (not the server):

```bash
# Generate an Ed25519 key (recommended — stronger than RSA, shorter keys)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Or RSA 4096-bit if Ed25519 is not supported
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

When prompted for a passphrase, **set one** — it protects your key if your laptop is compromised.

Most cloud providers let you upload your public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) during VPS creation. If your provider doesn't, copy it after first login:

```bash
# Copies your public key to the server so you can log in without a password
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Log in to your VPS using your SSH key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Download the latest package lists, then install all available updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Create a dedicated user account for running OpenClaw (not root)
sudo adduser openclaw
# Give that user permission to run admin commands with "sudo"
sudo usermod -aG sudo openclaw
```

### Firewall Configuration (Critical)

Only allow SSH from your IP. **Never allow `0.0.0.0/0` (anywhere) access.**

```bash
# Block ALL incoming connections by default (nothing gets in unless you allow it)
sudo ufw default deny incoming
# Allow all outgoing connections (your server can still reach the internet)
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
# Punch a hole for SSH (port 22) so you don't lock yourself out
sudo ufw allow ssh
# Turn the firewall on — defaults must be set FIRST
sudo ufw enable

# Show the current firewall rules to confirm everything looks right
sudo ufw status
```

**Cloud firewall**: Also configure your provider's firewall (Security Groups on AWS, etc.) to only allow SSH from your IP. Do **not** open 18789 to the public internet.

### SSH Hardening (Critical)

Disable password authentication and root login to prevent brute-force attacks:

```bash
# Open the SSH server config file in a text editor
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find and set (or uncomment) these lines:

```
PermitRootLogin no              # Nobody can SSH in as "root" directly
PasswordAuthentication no       # Only key-based login allowed (no password guessing)
PubkeyAuthentication yes        # Enable SSH key authentication
```

**Before reloading**, validate the config to avoid locking yourself out:

```bash
# Dry-run the SSH config — catches typos before they take effect
# If you see no output, the config is valid
sudo sshd -t
```

If the test passes with no output, reload SSH to apply the changes:

```bash
# Tell the SSH service to re-read its config (existing connections stay open)
sudo systemctl reload ssh
```

**Lockout prevention:** Open a **second terminal** and test SSH login before closing your current session. If the new connection works, you're safe. If it fails, fix `sshd_config` in the still-open session.

> **Beginner tip:** If you do get locked out, use your provider's web console (DigitalOcean "Access" tab, AWS "EC2 Instance Connect", etc.) to fix the config.

### Swap File Setup

Small VPS instances (1-2 GB RAM) can run out of memory during agent sessions, causing the process to be killed (OOM). A swap file acts as emergency overflow:

```bash
# Allocate a 2GB file on disk to use as swap (virtual memory)
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
# Only root should read/write the swap file (security best practice)
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
# Format the file as swap space
sudo mkswap /swapfile
# Activate the swap immediately
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Add it to /etc/fstab so it activates automatically after a reboot
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Confirm swap is active — you should see "Swap: 2.0G" in the output
free -h
```

### NTP Time Synchronization `[Intermediate]`

Accurate timestamps are essential for security log correlation and debugging. Most cloud providers sync time automatically, but verify and install `chrony` if needed:

```bash
# Check if your system clock is being synced — look for "NTP service: active"
timedatectl status

# If NTP is inactive, install chrony (a lightweight time sync daemon)
sudo apt install chrony
# Start chrony on boot
sudo systemctl enable chrony

# Confirm it's syncing — "Leap status: Normal" means it's working
chronyc tracking
```

---

## 2) Install OpenClaw `[All]`

On the VPS:

```bash
# Download and run the official OpenClaw installer
# (installs the openclaw binary and its dependencies including Node.js)
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Verify Node.js version (22.12.0+ recommended for security patches):

```bash
node --version  # Should be v22.12.0 or later
```

Then onboard — this walks you through initial setup and creates a background service:

```bash
# Interactive setup wizard + installs a systemd service so the gateway
# starts automatically on boot
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Set a gateway auth token for production:

```bash
# Generate a random 64-character hex token (cryptographically secure)
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
# Save it to your shell profile so it persists across logins
echo "export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN='$OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN'" >> ~/.profile
```

If you're headless and need OAuth-style auth, do the auth step on a trusted machine first and copy the required credential files as documented.

Docs: <https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started>

### Non-interactive onboarding (CI/CD and automation)

For automated deployments or custom LLM providers (Ollama, LM Studio, LiteLLM proxy, etc.), use the non-interactive flow:

```bash
# Using env var for API key (recommended — avoids process list exposure)
export CUSTOM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --accept-risk --install-daemon \
  --custom-base-url "https://llm.example.com/v1" \
  --custom-model-id "my-model" \
  --custom-compatibility openai

# Or with explicit auth choice and all options
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --accept-risk --install-daemon \
  --auth-choice custom-api-key \
  --custom-base-url "http://localhost:11434/v1" \
  --custom-model-id "llama3" \
  --custom-provider-id "ollama" \
  --custom-compatibility openai
```

Available `--custom-*` flags:

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--custom-base-url <url>` | Yes | Provider endpoint URL |
| `--custom-model-id <id>` | Yes | Model identifier |
| `--custom-api-key <key>` | No | API key (falls back to `CUSTOM_API_KEY` env var, then auth profile) |
| `--custom-provider-id <id>` | No | Provider identifier (auto-derived from URL if omitted) |
| `--custom-compatibility <mode>` | No | `openai` (default) or `anthropic` |

> **Security:** Avoid passing API keys via `--custom-api-key` flag in shared environments — they're visible in process lists. Use `CUSTOM_API_KEY` env var instead.

Docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/wizard-cli-automation

---

## 3) Keep the Gateway loopback-only `[All]`

This is the safest remote pattern:

- Gateway listens only on `127.0.0.1:18789`.
- You forward it when you need access.

---

## 4) Access it remotely (recommended) `[All]`

### Option A: Tailscale (recommended)

Tailscale is the recommended way to access your VPS. It provides encrypted transport, identity-based authentication, and auto-TLS — with zero ports exposed to the public internet. No nginx or certbot needed.

Install Tailscale on both the VPS and your personal devices, then use Tailscale Serve to publish the Gateway over HTTPS to your private tailnet. Full walkthrough in [section 12](#12-tailscale-setup-recommended-intermediate).

Docs: <https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/tailscale>

### Option B: SSH tunnel (universal fallback)

If you can't use Tailscale (e.g., corporate policy, no Tailscale account), SSH tunnelling works everywhere:

```bash
# Create an SSH tunnel: forwards your laptop's port 18789 to the VPS's port 18789
# -N means "don't open a shell, just forward the port"
# This must stay running — closing the terminal closes the tunnel
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@gateway-host
```

Now your local browser can open:

- <http://127.0.0.1:18789/>

…and your local CLI can talk to the Gateway at the forwarded URL. The downside is you must keep the SSH session open, and there's no auto-TLS or identity-based auth.

Docs: <https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/remote>

---

## 5) Verify and lock down `[All]`

On the VPS:

```bash
# Check if the gateway process is running and listening
openclaw gateway status
# Show overall OpenClaw status (all components)
openclaw status
# Run a health check — confirms the service is responding
openclaw health
# Deep security scan — checks config, permissions, and known issues
openclaw security audit --deep
```

If the audit finds issues, it can auto-fix many of them:

```bash
# Automatically apply recommended security fixes
openclaw security audit --fix
```

---

## 6) Logging + troubleshooting on a server `[All]`

Common troubleshooting workflow:

```bash
# Show status of all OpenClaw components (gateway, agents, channels)
openclaw status --all
# Stream live logs — useful for watching what happens in real time (Ctrl+C to stop)
openclaw logs --follow
```

If the service appears running but the probe fails:

- you may have a profile/config mismatch
- or the process is alive but not listening

Docs: <https://docs.openclaw.ai/help/faq>

---

## 7) Operational advice for VPS safety `[All]`

- Keep plugins to a minimum.
- Use separate messaging accounts for the bot.
- Treat browser control endpoints as admin APIs.
- Rotate tokens and API keys if you suspect exposure.
- Keep `~/.openclaw/` permissions tight (`chmod 700 ~/.openclaw`).

### Disable mDNS/Bonjour discovery

By default, the OpenClaw Gateway broadcasts its presence on the local network using mDNS (Multicast DNS, also called Bonjour). It advertises a `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service so that OpenClaw clients (desktop app, mobile apps) can auto-discover the Gateway without manual configuration.

On a VPS, this is a problem:

- **Shared hosting**: other tenants on the same network segment can see that OpenClaw is running and learn your hostname.
- **Dedicated VPS**: mDNS is link-local only (doesn't cross routers), so the risk is lower, but there's still no benefit — you're accessing via SSH tunnel or Tailscale, not local discovery.

Disable it by adding to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export OPENCLAW_DISABLE_BONJOUR=1
```

Or set it in `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "discovery": {
    "mdns": { "mode": "off" }
  }
}
```

Source: `src/infra/bonjour.ts:29`, `src/gateway/server-discovery-runtime.ts:27`. Cross-reference: [Threat model - mDNS/Bonjour](../04-privacy-safety/threat-model.md#6-mdnsbonjour-network-discovery), [Hardening checklist section 10](../04-privacy-safety/hardening-checklist.md#10-control-mdnsbonjour-discovery).

### Protect shell history from credential leakage

```bash
# Add to ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc
# ignoreboth = don't save commands that start with a space OR duplicate commands
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
# Set history file size to 0 = don't write any commands to the on-disk history file
# (prevents tokens/keys you typed from being saved to ~/.bash_history)
export HISTFILESIZE=0
```

Docs: <https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security>

---

## 8) Automatic Security Updates `[All]`

Keep your system patched automatically:

```bash
# Install the automatic update tool
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
# Interactive setup — select "Yes" to enable automatic security updates
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```

This ensures critical security patches are applied without manual intervention.

---

## 9) SSH Hardening with Fail2ban `[All]`

Protect against SSH brute force attacks:

```bash
# Install fail2ban — monitors SSH login attempts and bans IPs after too many failures
sudo apt install fail2ban
# Start fail2ban on boot
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
# Start it now
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

Check status:

```bash
# Shows how many IPs are currently banned and total failed attempts
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

## 10) Systemd Service and Resource Limits `[Intermediate]`

The `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` command creates a systemd user service. If you need to customize it or create one manually, here is a complete service file.

### Complete systemd user service file

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenClaw Gateway
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=%h/.openclaw/bin/openclaw gateway run
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

# Resource limits (adjust for your VPS size)
MemoryMax=1G
CPUQuota=80%

# Security hardening
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=read-only
ReadWritePaths=%h/.openclaw

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
# Tell systemd to re-read service files (picks up your new/changed file)
systemctl --user daemon-reload
# Start the service automatically on boot
systemctl --user enable openclaw-gateway
# Start it right now
systemctl --user start openclaw-gateway

# By default, user services stop when you log out. "Linger" keeps them
# running even when you're not SSH'd in — essential for an always-on server
loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)
```

### System-level service (alternative)

If you run OpenClaw as a system service instead (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/openclaw-gateway.service`), add the same resource limits:

```ini
[Service]
MemoryMax=1G
CPUQuota=80%
```

Then reload:

```bash
# Re-read service files to pick up changes
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# Restart the service with new limits applied
sudo systemctl restart openclaw-gateway
```

This prevents runaway processes from consuming all system resources.

---

## 10a) Backup and Restore `[All]`

OpenClaw stores configuration, credentials, and session data in `~/.openclaw/`. Back it up regularly.

### Create a backup

```bash
# Full backup — compresses the entire .openclaw/ directory into a dated archive
# "tar czf" = create (c) a gzip-compressed (z) archive file (f)
tar czf openclaw-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C ~/ .openclaw/

# Privacy-conscious backup — same thing but skips chat logs and temp files
tar czf openclaw-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  --exclude='.openclaw/sessions' \
  --exclude='.openclaw/workspace' \
  -C ~/ .openclaw/
```

### Restore from backup

```bash
# Stop the gateway so files aren't being written while we restore
systemctl --user stop openclaw-gateway

# Extract the backup archive into your home directory
# "tar xzf" = extract (x) a gzip-compressed (z) archive file (f)
tar xzf openclaw-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C ~/

# Lock down permissions — 700 means only your user can access the directory
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw
# 600 means only your user can read/write the config file (contains secrets)
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Start the gateway again with the restored config
systemctl --user start openclaw-gateway
```

### Recommendations

- Store backups in an **encrypted location** (e.g., LUKS volume, encrypted S3 bucket). The backup contains API keys and tokens in plaintext.
- Schedule weekly backups via cron:

```bash
# Add a weekly cron job: runs every Sunday at 2 AM, creates a dated backup archive
echo "0 2 * * 0 $(whoami) tar czf /home/$(whoami)/backups/openclaw-backup-\$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C /home/$(whoami)/ .openclaw/" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab > /dev/null
```

---

## 10b) Browser Agent on Headless VPS `[Intermediate]`

If you want OpenClaw's browser agent to work on a headless VPS, you need a headless Chromium installation. OpenClaw manages the browser process internally — do **not** run a standalone Chrome/CDP service.

### Install headless Chromium

```bash
# Install Chromium from Ubuntu's package manager (gets automatic security updates)
sudo apt install chromium-browser

# Confirm it installed — prints the version number
chromium-browser --version
```

### Configure OpenClaw

Add to `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "evaluateEnabled": false
  }
}
```

`evaluateEnabled: false` prevents arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser context — see [section 17](#17-openclaw-config-hardening-advanced) for full config hardening.

### What NOT to do

- Do **not** install Chrome via Homebrew, snap, or standalone `.deb` packages — `apt` is simpler and gets security updates automatically.
- Do **not** run a standalone Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) service on a fixed port (e.g., `--remote-debugging-port=18800`). This exposes a high-privilege debug interface. OpenClaw launches and manages its own browser instance.
- Do **not** install third-party browser management packages (`agent-browser`, etc.) — OpenClaw's gateway handles browser lifecycle internally.

---

## 11) DigitalOcean 1-Click Deploy `[All]`

> **Fastest path to a hardened VPS.** The DigitalOcean Marketplace app pre-configures security best practices automatically.

Official resources:

- Marketplace: <https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/moltbot>
- Tutorial: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-moltbot>

### What 1-Click handles for you

The 1-Click deployment configures these security controls out of the box:

| Control | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Authenticated gateway token | Auto-generated; protects against unauthorized access |
| Hardened firewall rules | Rate-limiting on OpenClaw ports to prevent DoS |
| Non-root execution | OpenClaw runs as a non-root user, limiting attack surface |
| Docker container isolation | Sandboxed execution environment |
| Private DM pairing | Enabled by default; prevents unauthorized messaging |

### System requirements

| Usage Level | RAM | CPU | Recommended For |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----------------- |
| Personal (1-5 users) | 4GB | 2 | Individual use, few channels |
| Small Team (5-20) | 8GB | 4 | Multiple channels |
| Medium Team (20-50) | 16GB | 8 | Heavy usage |
| Large Team (50+) | 32GB | 16 | High-volume deployment |

### Step 1: Create the Droplet

**Via DigitalOcean Console:**

1. Sign in to DigitalOcean -> **Create Droplet**
2. Under **Choose an Image** -> **Marketplace** tab
3. Search for "OpenClaw" and select it
4. Choose at least **4GB RAM** (s-2vcpu-4gb or higher)
5. Add your SSH key under **Authentication**
6. Set a hostname (e.g., `openclaw-server`)
7. Click **Create Droplet**

**Via API:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
  '{"name":"openclaw-server","region":"nyc3","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"moltbot"}' \
  "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
```

### Step 2: Connect and configure

Wait for the Droplet to finish provisioning (the dashboard may say "ready" before SSH is available-retry after 60 seconds if needed).

```bash
ssh root@your_droplet_ip
```

The welcome message displays your **Dashboard URL**-save it for browser access.

**Interactive setup:**

1. Choose LLM Provider: Anthropic (recommended), Gradient, or OpenAI (coming soon)
2. Paste your API key when prompted
3. The clawdbot service restarts automatically

### Step 3: Access OpenClaw

**Terminal UI (TUI):**

```bash
/opt/clawdbot-tui.sh
```

**Web Dashboard:**

Open the Dashboard URL from the welcome message in your browser. The URL includes a gateway token for authentication.

### Step 4: Add messaging channels

**WhatsApp:**

```bash
/opt/clawdbot-cli.sh channels add
# Select WhatsApp -> scan the QR code with your phone
```

**Telegram:**

1. Run `/opt/clawdbot-cli.sh channels add` and select Telegram
2. Open Telegram -> chat with @BotFather -> send `/newbot`
3. Follow prompts to create your bot and get a token
4. Paste the bot token back into the CLI
5. Open the Dashboard URL and add your Telegram user ID to the allowlist
6. Start chatting with your bot

### Manual configuration

Edit `/opt/clawdbot.env` for provider, gateway, and channel settings:

```bash
nano /opt/clawdbot.env
systemctl restart clawdbot
```

### Troubleshooting commands

| Task | Command |
| ------ | --------- |
| Check service status | `systemctl status clawdbot` |
| View live logs | `journalctl -u clawdbot -f` |
| Edit environment | `nano /opt/clawdbot.env` |
| Start TUI | `/opt/clawdbot-tui.sh` |

### What's different from manual VPS setup

The 1-Click handles sections 1-3 of this guide automatically:

- VPS provisioning with Ubuntu 24.04 + Node.js 22 + Docker
- OpenClaw installation and service setup
- Gateway configuration with auth token

You still need to:

- Configure messaging channels (Step 4 above)
- Optionally add SSH tunnel or Tailscale for remote access (see [section 4](#4-access-it-remotely-recommended-all))
- Review the [Security Checklist](#security-checklist-vps) below

## 12) Tailscale Setup (recommended) `[Intermediate]`

> If you use Tailscale, you can skip sections 13 (Reverse Proxy) and 14 (TLS) entirely — Tailscale handles encrypted transport and identity-based auth automatically.

For most single-user VPS deployments, Tailscale is simpler and more secure than the nginx reverse proxy + certbot path. It provides built-in TLS, identity-based authentication, and zero port exposure.

### 12.1) VPS-side: Install and authenticate `[All]`

```bash
# Download and install the Tailscale VPN client
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Connect to your Tailscale account — prints a URL you open in a browser to log in
sudo tailscale up
```

For a **headless VPS** without a browser, generate an auth key from the [Tailscale admin console Keys page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys), then:

```bash
# Log in without a browser using a pre-generated auth key (replace XXXXX with your key)
sudo tailscale up --auth-key=tskey-auth-XXXXX
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
# Shows all devices on your tailnet and their connection status
tailscale status
# Prints just this machine's tailnet IP address (starts with 100.x.y.z)
tailscale ip -4
```

**Optional: Tailscale SSH** — To eliminate port 22 entirely (not just firewall it), enable Tailscale SSH:

```bash
# Enables SSH access over Tailscale using identity-based auth (no SSH keys needed)
sudo tailscale up --ssh
```

This lets tailnet users SSH to the VPS without `sshd` listening on a public port. You can then skip UFW rules for port 22 or disable `sshd` entirely. Tailscale SSH is separate from Tailscale Serve (which handles the Gateway UI) — both can be used together.

Verify from your local machine: `ssh user@100.x.y.z` should work without needing your SSH key.

### 12.2) Client-side: Install on your personal devices `[All]`

Install Tailscale on every device you'll use to access the VPS:

| Platform | Install Method |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| macOS | Download from <https://tailscale.com/download> or `brew install tailscale` |
| Windows | Download from <https://tailscale.com/download> |
| Linux | `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh \| sh` |
| iOS/Android | App Store / Play Store |

After installing on each device:

1. Open Tailscale and log in with the **same identity provider** (Google, Microsoft, Apple) you used for the VPS
2. Verify the device appears on the [Machines page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) in the admin console
3. Confirm you can reach the VPS by its tailnet IP: `ping 100.x.y.z`

### 12.3) Shields-up on personal devices `[All]`

`shields-up` blocks **all** incoming Tailscale connections to a device. Enable it on laptops and phones that only need to *initiate* connections to the VPS, never receive them:

```bash
# Run this on your LAPTOP/PHONE (not the VPS):
# Blocks all incoming connections from other tailnet devices to this machine
tailscale set --shields-up

# To allow incoming connections again later:
tailscale set --shields-up=false
```

This prevents other devices on your tailnet from connecting to your laptop — reducing attack surface if another tailnet device is compromised.

### 12.4) UFW firewall for Tailscale-only VPS `[Intermediate]`

If you **only** access the VPS via Tailscale (no public SSH), lock the firewall to the `tailscale0` interface.

> **Before running these commands:** Verify Tailscale is connected (`tailscale status`) and you can reach the VPS via its tailnet IP (`ping 100.x.y.z`). If Tailscale is down when you enable UFW, you will lose access. Your provider's web console (Hetzner Console, DigitalOcean "Access" tab, AWS "EC2 Instance Connect") is your recovery path if locked out.

```bash
# Block everything from the public internet by default
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Only allow traffic arriving through the Tailscale VPN tunnel
# "tailscale0" is the virtual network interface Tailscale creates
sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0

# Activate the firewall (must set defaults before enabling)
sudo ufw enable
# Review the rules — you should see "ALLOW IN" only for tailscale0
sudo ufw status verbose
```

This means port 22 is only reachable via tailnet, not the public internet. Your cloud provider's firewall should also deny public SSH.

### 12.5) Configure Tailscale Serve (tailnet-only HTTPS) `[Intermediate]`

`tailscale serve` exposes a local port to your tailnet with automatic TLS — no certbot needed:

```bash
# Expose your local gateway (port 18789) as HTTPS on your private tailnet
# --bg runs it in the background; --https=443 means it listens on standard HTTPS port
sudo tailscale serve --bg --https=443 127.0.0.1:18789

# See what's currently being served
tailscale serve status

# Remove the serve config (stops exposing the port)
tailscale serve reset
```

Tailscale handles TLS certificate provisioning automatically. Access at `https://<machine-name>.<tailnet>.ts.net/`.

Configure OpenClaw:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "tailscale": { "mode": "serve" },
    "auth": { "allowTailscale": true }
  }
}
```

Or via CLI: `openclaw gateway --tailscale serve`

### 12.6) Funnel (public internet) — use with caution `[Advanced]`

Funnel exposes your service to the **public internet**, not just your tailnet:

```bash
# Make the gateway accessible from the PUBLIC INTERNET (not just your tailnet)
# WARNING: anyone on the internet can reach this — use strong auth
sudo tailscale funnel --https=443 127.0.0.1:18789
```

Funnel ports are restricted to 443, 8443, or 10000.

**Warning:** If using Funnel, you **must** set `gateway.auth.mode: "password"` — Tailscale identity headers are NOT available for public internet requests. Avoid Funnel for browser control endpoints entirely.

### 12.7) ACL hardening (optional) `[Advanced]`

Restrict tailnet access so each user can only reach their own devices. Set this in the [Tailscale admin console ACL editor](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls):

```json
{
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["autogroup:member"],
      "dst": ["autogroup:self:*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the "users access own devices" pattern — prevents other tailnet members from reaching your VPS.

### Configuration reference

| Key | Value | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- | --------- |
| `gateway.bind` | `"loopback"` | Keep Gateway on 127.0.0.1 |
| `gateway.tailscale.mode` | `"serve"` / `"funnel"` / `"off"` | Exposure level |
| `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` | `true` | Accept Tailscale identity headers |
| `gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit` | `true` | Clean up Serve config on shutdown |

### Security notes

- **Serve** = tailnet-only (recommended). **Funnel** = public internet (forces `auth.mode: "password"`).
- `allowTailscale: true` lets requests from the Tailscale proxy auto-authenticate via identity headers — no manual token entry needed.
- Avoid Funnel for browser control endpoints.
- Tailscale handles TLS automatically — no certbot needed.

**Prerequisites:** Tailscale CLI installed, logged in, HTTPS enabled on your tailnet (for Serve).

## 13) Reverse Proxy Hardening (nginx) `[Advanced]`

> Skip this section if you chose Tailscale Serve ([section 12](#12-tailscale-setup-recommended-intermediate)) — Tailscale handles TLS and doesn't need a reverse proxy.

OpenClaw has **no built-in rate limiting** ([#8594](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/8594)) and only adds security headers on Control UI endpoints. A reverse proxy fills both gaps.

### Install nginx

```bash
# Install the nginx web server (acts as a middleman between the internet and OpenClaw)
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Full hardened config

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/openclaw`:

```nginx
# Rate limiting zones
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=general:10m rate=10r/s;
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=auth:10m    rate=3r/s;

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # TLS (certbot fills these in — see section 14)
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options           "DENY" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
    add_header Permissions-Policy        "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()" always;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy   "default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'" always;

    # Request body limit (mitigates large-payload DoS)
    client_max_body_size 10m;

    # General rate limit
    limit_req zone=general burst=20 nodelay;

    # Stricter rate limit for auth endpoints
    location /api/auth {
        limit_req zone=auth burst=5 nodelay;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # Main proxy with WebSocket support
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket upgrade
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }

    # Optional: IP allowlist (uncomment and replace with your IP)
    # allow YOUR_IP;
    # deny all;
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Enable the site:

```bash
# Create a symbolic link to activate the config (nginx reads from sites-enabled/)
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/openclaw /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# Remove the default "Welcome to nginx" site
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

**Note:** Run `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx` only **after** obtaining your TLS certificate in [section 14](#14-tls-termination-advanced). The config above references certificate paths that won't exist until certbot creates them.

### Configure trusted proxies (mandatory)

When using a reverse proxy, you **must** tell OpenClaw to trust the proxy's `X-Forwarded-For` header. Add to `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "trustedProxies": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```

Without this, IP-based rate limiting and logging will see the proxy IP instead of the real client IP.

Cross-reference: [Hardening checklist section 11](../04-privacy-safety/hardening-checklist.md#11-configure-trusted-proxies)

Docs: [gateway/security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security), [nginx rate limiting](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module)

---

## 14) TLS Termination `[Advanced]`

> Skip this section if you chose Tailscale Serve ([section 12](#12-tailscale-setup-recommended-intermediate)) — TLS is automatic.

OpenClaw does not set HSTS headers. A reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt TLS fixes this.

### Install certbot

```bash
# Install certbot (the Let's Encrypt client) and its nginx plugin
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### Obtain certificate

```bash
# Request a free TLS certificate for your domain and auto-configure nginx
# You'll be asked for an email address and to agree to terms of service
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

Certbot will automatically update your nginx config with certificate paths.

### Auto-renewal

```bash
# Set up a cron job that checks for certificate renewal twice daily (at midnight and noon)
# The random sleep prevents millions of servers hitting Let's Encrypt at the same second
SLEEPTIME=$(awk 'BEGIN{srand(); print int(rand()*(3600+1))}')
echo "0 0,12 * * * root sleep $SLEEPTIME && certbot renew -q" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab > /dev/null
```

This checks for renewal twice daily with a random delay to avoid Let's Encrypt traffic spikes.

Docs: [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org), [gateway/tailscale](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/tailscale)

---

## 15) Encrypted Storage for Secrets `[Advanced]`

OpenClaw stores **all secrets** (API keys, OAuth tokens, gateway tokens) in **plaintext** on disk. Filesystem permissions (`0600`/`0700`) are the only protection. No built-in encryption-at-rest exists.

### Option A: LUKS encrypted partition

```bash
# Install the disk encryption tools
sudo apt install cryptsetup

# Set up encryption on an empty disk/partition — DESTROYS ALL DATA on /dev/sdX
# You'll be asked to create a passphrase (this unlocks the disk on reboot)
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
# Unlock the encrypted volume (prompts for your passphrase)
sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX openclaw-vault
# Create a filesystem inside the encrypted volume
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/openclaw-vault

# Mount it as the OpenClaw data directory
sudo mount /dev/mapper/openclaw-vault /home/openclaw/.openclaw
# Give the openclaw user ownership
sudo chown openclaw:openclaw /home/openclaw/.openclaw
```

Add a systemd mount dependency so the OpenClaw service waits for decryption:

```ini
# In /etc/systemd/system/openclaw-gateway.service
[Unit]
RequiresMountsFor=/home/openclaw/.openclaw
```

**Note:** Requires manual unlock on reboot (or a key file, which trades convenience for security).

### Option B: Provider-level encryption

| Provider | Encryption-at-rest |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| DigitalOcean | Block storage volumes encrypted by default |
| AWS | Enable EBS encryption on the volume |
| Hetzner | Enable LUKS at provisioning time |

### What this protects

- Disk theft, decommissioned VPS, snapshot exposure.

### What this does NOT protect

- Running process memory, authenticated SSH access.

Docs: [gateway/security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security) (confirms no built-in encryption)

---

## 16) Docker Deployment Hardening `[Advanced]`

The default `docker-compose.yml` binds to `0.0.0.0` (lan mode) and has no security options enabled.

### Override the bind address

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND=loopback
```

This overrides the default `${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND:-lan}` in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Docker Compose security overlay

Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` or add to your existing compose file:

```yaml
services:
  openclaw-gateway:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CHOWN
      - SETUID
      - SETGID
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /home/node/.openclaw/workspace
    pids_limit: 256
    mem_limit: 1g
```

**Note:** The `--no-sandbox` Chrome flag is required in containers (Dockerfile default) and cannot be avoided.

### OpenClaw sandbox Docker config

These settings control the Docker sandbox that OpenClaw creates for agent sessions. Add to `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "all",
        "docker": {
          "network": "none",
          "readOnlyRoot": true,
          "capDrop": ["ALL"],
          "pidsLimit": 100,
          "memory": "512m"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Caveat:** `readOnlyRoot`, `capDrop`, `pidsLimit`, and `memory` are defined in source code (`src/config/types.sandbox.ts`) but not yet in official docs. They work (tested in `src/config/config.sandbox-docker.test.ts`) but may change between releases.

Docs: [Docker Compose services reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/), [gateway/sandboxing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/sandboxing)

---

## 17) OpenClaw Config Hardening `[Advanced]`

Several security-relevant config options exist but aren't enabled by default. This section consolidates recommended settings for a hardened VPS deployment.

### Recommended `openclaw.json`

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token"
    },
    "trustedProxies": ["127.0.0.1"],
    "controlUi": {
      "dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth": false
    }
  },
  "browser": {
    "evaluateEnabled": false
  },
  "plugins": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "sandbox": {
        "mode": "all",
        "workspaceAccess": "ro"
      }
    }
  },
  "logging": {
    "redactSensitive": "tools"
  }
}
```

### Setting explanations

| Setting | Why |
| --------- | ----- |
| `gateway.bind: "loopback"` | Only listen on 127.0.0.1 — access via SSH tunnel or Tailscale |
| `gateway.auth.mode: "token"` | Require bearer token for all requests ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)) |
| `gateway.trustedProxies: ["127.0.0.1"]` | Required if using reverse proxy — prevents X-Forwarded-For spoofing ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)) |
| `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth: false` | Prevents silently weakening auth |
| `browser.evaluateEnabled: false` | Disables arbitrary JS execution in browser context (`src/config/types.browser.ts:34`) |
| `plugins.enabled: false` | Avoids plugin HTTP route auth bypass ([#8512](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/8512)) |
| `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "all"` | All sessions run in Docker sandbox ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/sandboxing)) |
| `agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceAccess: "ro"` | Read-only workspace prevents file tampering ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)) |
| `logging.redactSensitive: "tools"` | Redact secrets from tool output logs ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security)) |

### Gateway token

Set via environment variable (>= 32 characters):

```bash
# Generate a new random 64-character hex token and set it as an environment variable
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

### Verify

After applying changes, run:

```bash
openclaw security audit --deep
```

Docs: [gateway/security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security), [gateway/sandboxing](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/sandboxing)

---

## 18) Gateway Token Rotation `[Advanced]`

OpenClaw has no auto-rotation for gateway tokens. A simple cron script fills the gap.

### Rotation script

The script depends on how OpenClaw was installed. The default `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` stores the token in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and runs as a **systemd user service** (`openclaw-gateway.service`). The DO 1-Click uses a system service with `/opt/clawdbot.env`.

**Default install** (systemd user service — most manual VPS setups):

Create `/usr/local/bin/rotate-openclaw-token.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rotation script for default OpenClaw installs
# Token location: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
# Service: systemd user unit "openclaw-gateway.service"

OPENCLAW_USER="openclaw"
OPENCLAW_HOME="/home/${OPENCLAW_USER}"
CONFIG="${OPENCLAW_HOME}/.openclaw/openclaw.json"

# Generate a new random token
NEW_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Replace the token in openclaw.json using jq (a JSON command-line processor)
# Writes to a temp file first to avoid corrupting the config if interrupted
jq --arg t "$NEW_TOKEN" '.gateway.auth.token = $t' "$CONFIG" > "${CONFIG}.tmp" \
  && mv "${CONFIG}.tmp" "$CONFIG" \
  && chown "${OPENCLAW_USER}:${OPENCLAW_USER}" "$CONFIG"

# Restart the gateway so it picks up the new token
sudo -u "$OPENCLAW_USER" XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/$(id -u $OPENCLAW_USER)" \
  systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway

# Log the rotation for audit trail
echo "$(date): Token rotated" >> /var/log/openclaw-token-rotation.log
```

**DO 1-Click install** (system service with env file):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rotation script for DigitalOcean 1-Click installs
# Token location: /opt/clawdbot.env, service name: "clawdbot"

NEW_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
# Find the OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN line in the env file and replace its value
sed -i "s/^OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=.*/OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=${NEW_TOKEN}/" /opt/clawdbot.env
# Restart the service so it reads the new token
systemctl restart clawdbot
echo "$(date): Token rotated" >> /var/log/openclaw-token-rotation.log
```

Make it executable:

```bash
# Mark the script as executable so cron can run it
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rotate-openclaw-token.sh
```

**Prerequisite:** The default install script uses `jq` — install with `sudo apt install jq` if not present.

### Schedule monthly rotation

```bash
# Add a monthly cron job: runs at 3 AM on the 1st of each month as root
echo "0 3 1 * * root /usr/local/bin/rotate-openclaw-token.sh" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab > /dev/null
```

Runs at 3 AM on the first of each month.

**Important:** After rotation, update any bookmarked dashboard URLs or SSH tunnel configs that embed the old token.

Docs: [gateway/security](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security) (token auth docs)
