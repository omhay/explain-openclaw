## High-level data flow

```
Messaging apps (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/iMessage/...)  
        │
        ▼
Gateway (single always-on process)
  - channel ingress/egress
  - input sanitization (strip metadata, control chars)
  - routing + policy checks
  - sessions (disk)
  - agent turns → block reply pipeline
  - tool calls
        │
        ▼
AI provider(s) (Anthropic/OpenAI/etc.) OR local model endpoint
        │

Back to the channel
```

OpenClaw is **Gateway-centric**. Most things you do (status, logs, pairing, sending, agent runs) talk to the Gateway via its WebSocket RPC.

---

## The Gateway is the control plane

The Gateway:
- binds a single port (default `18789`) and multiplexes:
  - WebSocket control plane
  - Control UI / dashboard
  - optional HTTP endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/tools/invoke`)
- owns channel connections (WhatsApp Web session, Telegram bot long-poll, etc.)
- owns local state (config, credentials, transcripts)

It also enforces startup auth safety:
- if auth mode resolves to token but no token exists, startup generates one (`ensureGatewayStartupAuth`) and persists it when running without ephemeral overrides.
- non-loopback binds are refused without shared-secret auth (except explicit `trusted-proxy` mode with trusted proxy IPs configured).

### Config validation as a safety feature
In `src/gateway/server.impl.ts`, the Gateway:
- reads config snapshot
- migrates legacy config entries when possible
- refuses to start on invalid schema

This is intentional: unknown keys and malformed values are treated as unsafe.

Docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/configuration

### Input sanitization

`src/gateway/chat-sanitize.ts` strips platform envelope metadata (WhatsApp headers, message IDs, control characters) from user messages before processing. `sanitizeChatSendMessageInput()` (`src/gateway/server-methods/chat.ts:80`) rejects null bytes and strips disallowed control characters, allowing only tabs, newlines, carriage returns, and printable characters through.

### Config merge-patch

`src/config/merge-patch.ts` implements ID-based array merging for config overlays. When patching arrays of objects that have `id` fields, it merges by matching IDs rather than positional replacement, preventing accidental overwrite of security-critical config entries.

## Key modules in this repo (where to look)

### CLI
- Entry script: `src/entry.ts` → loads CLI main.
- Command wiring: `src/cli/`.
- Gateway CLI docs: `docs/cli/gateway.md`.

### Gateway
- Gateway start + core runtime: `src/gateway/` (entry in `src/gateway/server.impl.ts`).
- WebSocket runtime + methods live under `src/gateway/server-*` modules.

### Channels
- Core channel implementations are in per-channel folders (e.g. `src/telegram`, `src/discord`, `src/imessage`, `src/web`, etc.).
- Shared channel logic + routing helpers live in `src/channels/`.

### Auto-reply / agent turns
- The “reply pipeline” is under `src/auto-reply/`.
- `src/auto-reply/reply/agent-runner.ts` is a central orchestrator for running a turn, managing session updates, typing signals, tool output emission rules, follow-ups, etc.

### Config schema
- Types are exported from `src/config/types.ts` (split into many `types.*.ts` files).
- The docs describe strict schema validation and how the UI uses it.

### Daemon
- `src/daemon/` (~37 files as of Feb 2026). Cross-platform service management: systemd (Linux), launchd (macOS), schtasks (Windows). Handles Gateway lifecycle as a background service.

### Memory
- `src/memory/`. Persistent knowledge layer with SQLite + sqlite-vec storage, markdown chunking, embedding providers, hybrid search. (Detailed in [`resource-usage.md` Section F](../06-optimizations/resource-usage.md#f-how-openclaw-memory-works-architecture-deep-dive).)

### Plugins
- `src/plugins/`. Plugin loading via jiti, hook registration, marketplace integration.

### Security
- `src/security/`. Security audit (`openclaw security audit`), scan path helpers, fix application.

### Browser
- `src/browser/`. Chromium automation via Playwright CDP. Screenshot normalization, AX tree traversal, extension relay.

### TTS
- `src/tts/`. Text-to-speech via ElevenLabs/OpenAI/Edge TTS APIs.

### Cron
- `src/cron/`. Scheduled job execution with timer loop and run logging.

### Media
- `src/media/`. Media fetch (now bounded via `readResponseWithLimit()`), image optimization, input file processing, MIME detection.

### Hooks
- `src/hooks/`. Bundled hooks (command logger, session memory) + user-configurable hooks.

### TUI
- `src/tui/`. Terminal UI components for CLI interactions.

### Link understanding
- `src/link-understanding/`. URL content extraction and summarization.

### Canvas host
- `src/canvas-host/`. Interactive canvas rendering for rich outputs.

## Message lifecycle (detailed)

Below is a conceptual pipeline. Exact details vary by channel.

1) **Ingress**
- A channel adapter receives an event (DM/group message, attachment, mention).

1.5) **Input sanitization**
- Strip platform envelope metadata from user messages (`src/gateway/chat-sanitize.ts`)
- Reject null bytes and strip unsafe control characters (`src/gateway/server-methods/chat.ts:80`)

2) **Identity + authorization**
- Resolve sender identity.
- Apply DM policy (pairing/allowlist/open/disabled).
- Apply group policy (mention gating, allowlists, command gating).

3) **Routing decision**
- Determine the target agent/session key.
- In many configs, DMs collapse into a “main” session; groups are isolated.

4) **Context assembly**
- Load transcript/session store entries from disk.
- Build the agent prompt context (templates + system prompt + history + attachments).

5) **Model call (agent turn)**
- Call the selected provider/model (with fallback logic if configured).
- Stream output events.
- If the model requests tools, invoke them via the Gateway’s tool execution policy.

6) **Response delivery**
- **Block reply pipeline** (`src/auto-reply/reply/reply-delivery.ts`): normalizes streaming text, processes reply directives (`[[MEDIA:url]]`, `SILENT_REPLY_TOKEN`), manages typing signals.
- Convert agent output into channel-specific messages.
- Apply reply threading rules, chunking, etc.
- Send back to the channel.

7) **Persistence**
- Append transcript and metadata updates to disk.

## Ports (what listens where)

Default base port: `18789`.

On that port:
- WebSocket control plane
- Dashboard (HTTP)

Related derived ports may exist (browser control, canvas host), depending on configuration.

Docs:
- https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway (service runbook)
- https://docs.openclaw.ai/help/faq (port precedence)

---

## Where state lives (operator view)

The most important directory is your state dir:
- default: `~/.openclaw/`
- per-profile: `~/.openclaw-<profile>/`

Common paths (see official "credential storage map"):
- config: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- model auth profiles: `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- transcripts: `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl`

Docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security

## Why “security” is mostly configuration

Most security failures are not exotic. They are:
- open DMs/groups
- enabled high-power tools
- exposed Gateway surface without auth
- untrusted plugin installation

That's why `openclaw security audit` exists and why config validation is strict.
